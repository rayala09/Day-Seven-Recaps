<!-- What are modules? -->

<!-- Answers -->

<!-- 1. Modules consist of classes and constructors. Specific objects from it may be exported to be acceses by other modules  -->

<h1>{{ford.make}} {{ford.model}} {{ford.year}}</h1>

<h2>{{honda.make}} {{honda.model}} {{honda.year}}</h2>


<!-- It did not work at first since we needed to export the class so that we have acces to its contrcutor and fields -->
